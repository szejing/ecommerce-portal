# Shipment Arrangement design QA

## Evidence

- Source visual truth: `/Users/szejinggo/Documents/Projects/ecommerce/docs/superpowers/plans/assets/2026-07-18-shipment-arrangement-option-2.png`
- Browser-rendered desktop implementation: `/Users/szejinggo/Documents/Projects/ecommerce/ecommerce-portal/.superpowers/sdd/qa/shipment-arrangement-desktop.png`
- Browser-rendered mobile implementation: `/Users/szejinggo/Documents/Projects/ecommerce/ecommerce-portal/.superpowers/sdd/qa/shipment-arrangement-mobile.png`
- Browser-rendered mobile actions/table state: `/Users/szejinggo/Documents/Projects/ecommerce/ecommerce-portal/.superpowers/sdd/qa/shipment-arrangement-mobile-lower.png`
- Full-view comparison: `/Users/szejinggo/Documents/Projects/ecommerce/ecommerce-portal/.superpowers/sdd/qa/shipment-arrangement-comparison.png`
- Focused workflow/filter comparison: `/Users/szejinggo/Documents/Projects/ecommerce/ecommerce-portal/.superpowers/sdd/qa/shipment-arrangement-focus-workflow.png`
- Canonical route: `http://localhost:3000/orders/shipment-arrangement` (the captured legacy route now redirects here).
- Viewports: desktop 1440 x 1024; mobile 390 x 844.
- State: authenticated-layout visual fixture with 24 pending batches and three representative rows. The fixture was used only for browser evidence and removed before completion; it is not part of the product code.

## Findings

- No actionable P0, P1, or P2 differences remain.
- The implementation preserves the approved guided-file-exchange hierarchy: three numbered steps, prominent export/import actions, a visible shipment consequence warning, compact filters, and a dense pending-batch table.
- The production table intentionally shows the six context fields defined in the approved implementation plan. Courier, tracking, validation status, and row-level messages appear in the import preview rather than the pending list; this is an intentional product constraint rather than visual drift.

## Required fidelity surfaces

- Fonts and typography: the existing portal sans-serif stack, heading weights, compact control labels, and muted helper text preserve the source hierarchy. No clipped or awkwardly truncated app copy was observed.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: desktop sections align to the portal content grid with consistent card radii, borders, and gaps. Mobile stacks workflow steps and primary actions without overlap; the table scrolls within its own card rather than expanding the page.
- Colors and visual tokens: existing portal tokens provide the white/neutral surfaces, orange primary emphasis, muted secondary text, blue delivery badges, and semantic yellow consequence warning shown by the source.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: this screen has no illustrative or photographic assets. Icons come from the project's existing icon library and remain optically consistent; no CSS art, emoji, or replacement SVG assets were introduced.
- Copy and content: copy clearly explains export, manual courier/tracking entry, preview, and the shipped/email consequence. Dynamic counts and representative order data fit the intended states.

## Responsive and interaction checks

- Desktop hierarchy and density checked at 1440 x 1024.
- Mobile top workflow and lower action/table states checked at 390 x 844.
- Page-level width check: `scrollWidth === clientWidth === 390`; the wide data table uses deliberate internal horizontal scrolling.
- Search input accepts text; Clear filters resets it.
- Delivery method selector opens with All, Standard, and Express options and updates the selected value.
- Import workbook opens the file chooser; a non-XLSX file produces the visible validation message `Select an XLSX workbook to continue.`
- Export and import actions remain visible and reachable on desktop and mobile.
- Apply was not exercised against live order data because it mutates shipment status and may send customer email; backend automated tests cover apply safety and partial failures.
- Browser console warnings/errors checked after the interaction pass: none.

## Comparison history

- Pass 1: full-view and focused workflow/filter comparisons found no actionable P0/P1/P2 mismatch. No visual code change was required, so no additional design-QA iteration was needed.

## Follow-up polish

- P3: the approved mock contains more sample rows than the visual fixture, making its table appear taller. This is data-state variance and does not affect production layout or behavior.

final result: passed
