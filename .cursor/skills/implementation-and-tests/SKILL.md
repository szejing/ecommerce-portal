# Implementation and tests (Wemotoo CRM Portal)

## Rule

**New or changed behavior must ship with tests.** Do not finish implementation without tests that prove the change (or clearly extend existing tests that already cover it).

- **Bugfix**: add or adjust a test that would have failed before the fix.
- **Feature**: add tests for the new public API, route, branch, or regression risk.
- **Refactor** (no behavior change): run existing tests; only add tests if coverage was missing for touched code.

## Where to put tests

| Area | Location | Runner | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Pure utils, server helpers (e.g. `server/base_api` exports) | `test/unit/**/*.spec.ts` | `vitest --project unit` | Node env, no Nuxt |
| Vue components / composables needing Nuxt (auto-imports, plugins) | `test/nuxt/**/*.nuxt.spec.ts` | `vitest --project nuxt` | `mountSuspended` / `@nuxt/test-utils/runtime` |
| Nitro merchant API proxies, HTTP integration | `test/e2e/**/*.spec.ts` | `vitest --project e2e` | `@nuxt/test-utils/e2e`, mock upstream as needed |
| Repository modules (`app/repository/`), `$fetch` contracts | `app/repository/**/*.test.ts` | `bun test` | Uses `test/repository-test-setup.ts` preload |

Config: `vitest.config.ts` (projects: `unit`, `e2e`, `nuxt`). Reference: [Nuxt 4 testing](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/testing).

## Checklist before claiming done

1. Identify which table row above applies (or more than one).
2. Add or update the smallest set of tests that validates the change.
3. Run **`bun run test:vitest:run`** for Vitest projects.
4. Run **`bun run test:repository`** when repository code changed.
5. Run **`bun run typecheck`** and **`bun run lint`** for user-facing or shared TypeScript changes when feasible.
6. Fix failures before reporting completion.

## Practical guidance

- Prefer **one clear test** over many shallow ones; cover happy path and one meaningful edge case when risk warrants it.
- **Repository modules**: assert URL, method, query/body, and error shaping against `MerchantRoutes` / fixtures in `test/repository-model-fixtures.ts` when applicable.
- **Nitro routes**: prefer e2e proxy tests with a mock upstream (`test/e2e/`) or extend patterns already in that folder; avoid hitting a real backend in CI.
- Do **not** add unrelated refactors or new markdown docs unless the user asked.
