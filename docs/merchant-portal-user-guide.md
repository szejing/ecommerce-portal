1. Go to **Orders**.
2. Use the filters:
   - Date range
   - Order number search
   - Status tabs: All, Pending, Completed, Cancelled, Refunded, Requires Action
3. Select an order from the table.
4. On the order detail page, review:
   - Order number, invoice number, reference number, and order date
   - Fulfilment method, such as pickup, delivery, or shipping method
   - Customer information
   - Order items
   - Remarks
   - Activity history
   - Order status, payment information, and shipment information

### Edit Customer Information

1. In **Customer Information**, click **Edit**.
2. Update contact details:
   - Customer name
   - Email address
   - Phone number
3. Update shipping and billing address details, if present.
4. Use **Same as shipping address** when billing address should match shipping address.
5. Click **Update**.

### Edit Order Items

Order items are editable only when the order is in an editable state, such as **Pending Payment**.

1. In **Order Items**, select an active item row.
2. Update the item status.
3. If the item has an appointment, update:
   - Appointment date
   - Appointment status
4. Review the pricing summary.
5. Click **Update**.

### Update Order Status

1. In the order actions panel, choose the new status.
2. Click **Update Order Status**.
3. Confirm the action if the portal asks for confirmation.

Completion validation is owned by the backend and follows the merchant's order-completion setting. If an update is rejected, review the required payment and fulfillment batch states before retrying.

### Add or Update Payment Information

1. In **Payment Information**, click **Add Payment** when there is no payment, or select an existing payment.
2. Enter or update:
   - Payment date and time
   - Payment type
   - Reference numbers
   - Payment amount
   - Currency
3. Click **Update**.

### Manage Shipping

Delivery order and sale details show shipping information in the desktop sidebar or mobile order-actions drawer. The card shows the shipping method, fee, zone, courier, and tracking number.

1. Click **Edit** to select the courier and enter the tracking number.
2. Save the first tracking number to mark that shipment as shipped automatically.
3. Click **Update status** and choose the available next packing or delivery status.
4. Refresh the detail after an update if you need to confirm the latest aggregate order status.

When an order has multiple fulfillment batches, the portal also shows the batch count plus lifecycle and shipment status badges for each batch. Fulfillment batches on converted sales remain editable. Batch deletion and splitting are not available yet, and completion validation remains backend-owned.

## Tips

- Use table filters before exporting data so the exported CSV matches the view you need.
- Use the refresh button on order detail pages after payment or fulfillment batch changes.
- Keep product codes short and stable, because they are used as identifiers in product detail pages.
- For services, confirm the store operating hours before using **Follow operation hour**.
